    <h3>
        1.9 (3/22/2010)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Features</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Added support for Windows Installer Patches (MSP) with an "msp" component type.</li>
                <li>Added <code>#UILEVEL</code> variable, current installer UI level, one of "full",
                    "silent" or "basic".</li>
                <li>Added <code>#LANGUAGE</code> and <code>#LANGID</code> variables, current configuration
                    language and locale id.</li>
                <li>Added <code>uninstall_display_name</code> to all components, optional component
                    display name during uninstall.</li>
                <li>Added <code>uninstall_package</code> to <code>msi</code> components, optional package
                    to use during uninstall.</li>
                <li>Added <code>uninstallation_none</code>, <code>uninstallation_completed</code> and
                    <code>uninstalling_component_wait</code> to setup configurations.</li>
                <li>Added support for multiple registry paths in <code>@[registry path]</code> substitutions.
                    Separate multiple paths with a <code>|</code> character.</li>
                <li>A default value is no longer required in registry substitutions, assumed blank.</li>
                <li>Added optional installed checks for user-defined controls. The check must evaluate
                    to <code>True</code> for the control to be displayed, enabled or both, depending
                    on the value of the new <code>check</code> option.</li>
                <li>Added <code>defaultvalue</code> options to <code>registry</code>, <code>file</code>
                    and <code>product</code> installed checks. The default value is used when the bootstrapper
                    does not find the registry key or file, ie. it cannot decide whether the component
                    is installed based on the specifics of the check (eg. version comparison with a
                    value that doesn't exist is not meaningful).</li>
                <li>Added <code>selected</code> option to components to select or de-select a component
                    by default.</li>
                <li>Added <code>key_exists</code> and <code>value_exists</code> operators to registry
                    installed checks. The <code>value_exists</code> operator allows one to check whether
                    the default registry key value is set.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Misc</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><code>/DisplayCab</code> truncates the files list for each cub at two items; rest
                    is shown as a summary.</li>
                <li>Failures to read or write embedded resources, including CABs, CAB directory, banner
                    and manifest, reports the file name affected by the error.</li>
                <li>Documented uninstall strategy for MSIs by remembering the product GUID in registry
                    under the "Install and Uninstall Sequences" section.</li>
                <li>Substantially improved peformance linking large bootstrappers with many embedded
                    files and components.</li>
                <li>Implemented work-around for "not enough storage space" system error while embedding
                    large CABs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bugs</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>MSI components ignore <code>uninstall_cmdparameters</code>, <code>uninstall_cmdparameters_silent</code>
                    and <code>uninstall_cmdparameters_basic</code>.</li>
                <li>MSU components don't property handle reboots with standard 3010 exit code.</li>
                <li>Extracting files from large embedded CABs with many files may not extract all files.</li>
                <li>Uninstall doesn't remove components and process configurations in reverse order.</li>
                <li>Progress status and labels encode &amp; characters as key access indicators instead
                    of rendering them as is.</li>
                <li>CMD components don't property reload <code>command_basic</code> and <code>uninstall_command_basic</code>
                    in InstallerEditor.</li>
                <li>InstallerEditor "Save" menu is not re-enabled after "Save As".</li>
                <li>Registry install checks with the <code>exists</code> operator for a blank field
                    value fail with a "The system cannot find the file specified." error.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        1.8 (1/20/2010)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Features</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Added support for uninstall sequences with new command-line <code>/i</code> and
                    <code>/x</code> switches, <code>supports_install</code>, <code>supports_uninstall</code>
                    global options in configurations, components and controls. Added extended uninstall
                    parameters in <code>cmd</code> and <code>msi</code> components.</li>
                <li>Added user-defined form controls and input for labels, checkboxes, edit boxes, hyperlinks
                    and file/directory browse controls.</li>
                <li>Added user-defined splash screen embedded with the InstallerLinker <code>/Splash</code>
                    option and an optional <code>/nosplash</code> switch to dotNetInstaller.</li>
                <li>dotNetInstaller: Added <code>/controlArgs "control id":"value"</code> to dotNetInstaller.exe
                    command line to override initial control values.</li>
                <li>Added <code>returncodes_reboot</code> to <code>cmd</code> components that specify
                    which return code(s) should be treated as a required reboot.</li>
                <li>Added <code>returncodes_success</code> to <code>cmd</code> components that specify
                    a list of comma-separated return code(s) that should be treated as success. Specify
                    "all" to create a component that doesn't fail based on its return code and specify
                    <code>!value</code> to treat all return codes except a single value as success.</li>
                <li>Added splash and manifest input to InstallerEditor's Make Exe dialog.</li>
                <li>Added support for a license agreement checkbox user-defined control.</li>
                <li>Added <code>dialog_message_copying</code> that displays instead of <code>dialog_message_downloading</code>
                    when the file is copied from <code>sourcepath</code>.</li>
                <li>The <code>dialog_message_downloading</code> and <code>dialog_message_copying</code>
                    replace <code>dialog_message</code> in download dialogs depending on whether a download
                    or a local copy is required.</li>
                <li>Added component <code>id</code> and renamed <code>description</code> to <code>display_name</code>.</li>
                <li>ComponentArgs now accepts <code>*</code>, <code>id</code> or <code>display_name</code>,
                    cumulative in this order.</li>
                <li>Added <code>clear_cache</code> to download components. When true, attempts to clear
                    the local internet cache entry for the url to download.</li>
                <li>Cabbing now embeds files that belong in components in separate resource streams,
                    extracting only those files that are necessary for installation of a particular
                    component. Embedded files outside of components continue to always be extracted.</li>
                <li>Changed default of <code>/EmbedResourceSize &lt;size in bytes&gt;</code> from 32MB
                    to 128MB.</li>
                <li>CAB extraction uses the memory-mapped resource streams and no longer writes temporary
                    files to extract embedded components. This significantly reduces disk space and
                    memory requirements and improves extraction speed.</li>
                <li>InstallerEditor now accepts a configuration file on the command-line and opens it.
                    You can also pass /? for command-line usage and success/failure return codes are
                    documented.</li>
                <li>InstallerEditor: added "Edit" menu with identical contents as the right click popup
                    on the currently selected configuration node.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bugs</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Bug: error creating temporary directory on Windows 95/98/ME.</li>
                <li>Bug: combining #PATH variables produces inconsistent backslash count for different
                    path types, which causes component execution failure on Windows 95/98/ME.</li>
                <li>Bug: component lcid filters broken.</li>
                <li>Bug: product installed checks may produce Error in ::IIDFromString: The parameter
                    is incorrect.</li>
                <li>Bug: adjusting X or Y coordinates of UI widgets doesn't preserve widget's width
                    or height.</li>
                <li>Bug: embedfolder nested within a component broken.</li>
                <li>Bug: download dialog will no longer appear when neither download nor copy is not
                    required.</li>
                <li>Bug: file and registry (DWORD and REG_SZ) version checks <code>version_lt</code>,
                    <code>version_gt</code>, <code>version_le</code> and <code>version_ge</code> are
                    broken: their results are inverted; if you have been using these checks, review
                    the documentation and adjust the check conditions.</li>
                <li>Bug: InstallerEditor's Make Exe dialog is closed when the user presses Cancel when
                    prompted for a target .exe file name.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Misc</strong>:
            <ul>

                    Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7.</li>
                <li>Extended registry search REG_MULTI_SZ semantics. You can now specify a comma-delimited
                    list of values to <code>match</code> exactly all values, <code>contains</code> to
                    match a subset of values and you can no longer specify a broken <code>version</code>
                    match.</li>
                <li>Added support for nested reference configurations. Each downloaded configuration
                    file is checked for more reference configurations. There's a nested depth limit
                    of 10 to avoid circular references.</li>
                <li>Added <code>/DisplayCab</code> command line option to dotNetInstaller.exe that displays
                    the embedded CAB file contents when available.</li>

                <li>Added support for <code>os_filter_smaller</code>, <code>os_filter_greater</code>
                    and <code>processor_architecture_filter</code> in web configurations.</li>
                <li>Added a product installed check that queries the MSI system database for a product
                    by it's product id or upgrade code and is capable of comparing product properties,
                    such as VersionString.</li>
                <li>Added an "msu" component type, similar to "msi" for Windows Update (.msu) packages.</li>
                <li>InstallerEditor and InstallerLinker no longer require elevation on Windows Vista
                    and Windows Server 2008.</li>
                <li>Unicows.dll is embedded and is no longer required for Windows 95 and 98 installers.
                    You can now distribute a single packaged setup for Windows 95 and 98 platforms.</li>
                <li>Added <code>/ConfigFile &lt;path\configuration.xml&gt;</code> option to the bootstrapper
                    to specify an alternate configuration file.</li>
                <li>dotNetInstaller process exit code is now 0 on success, process exit code is now
                    shell execute return code on an open file component failure, MSI return code on
                    an MSI component failure, process exit code on a non-zero cmd component return,
                    -2 on cancel from main dialog or download and -1 on any other error. Check <code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code>
                    in batch scripts.</li>
                <li>Added a directory exists installed check.</li>

                <li>Added <code>/?</code> or <code>/help</code> to the bootstrapper that shows the command
                    line syntax and options.</li>
                <li>Moved <code>log_enabled</code> and <code>log_file</code> options to the configuration
                    top level from individual install configurations.</li>
                <li>Added expansion of registry variables to configuration nodes in the format of <code>
                    @[KEY:OPTION\PATH\VALUE]</code> (eg. @[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CommonFilesDir]).</li>
                <li>Added expansion of environment variables to configuration nodes (eg. %TEMP%).</li>
                <li>All nodes in the configuration file, except boolean and strongly typed enumerations,
                    accept path (eg. #TEMPPATH), environment (eg. %TEMP%) and registry (eg. @[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CommonFilesDir])
                    variables.</li>
                <li>Added an optional user language selection dialog to the bootstrapper. Users can
                    pick amongst the languages available instead of choosing their locale or the one
                    of the operating system.</li>
                <li>Msi packages can now be GUIDs of installed products, in the {GUID} format. These
                    will not be resolved as a path.</li>
                <li>Added <code>/Manifest &lt;manifest file&gt;</code> to the installer linker to specify
                    a replacement manifest. This enables building bootstrappers that don't elevate on
                    Windows Vista, Server and Windows 7.</li>
                <li>Added <code>/EmbedResourceSize &lt;size in bytes&gt;</code> to installer linker
                    to specify the max size of each embedded resource. Defaults to 32Mb.</li>
                <li>Added <code>auto_start</code> setup configuration parameter that defines whether
                    to automatically start installation in full UI mode.</li>
                <li>Added <code>auto_continue_on_reboot</code> setup configuration parameter that defines
                    whether to auto-start installation after a reboot was forced during the installation.</li>
                <li>Added <code>reboot_cmd</code> setup configuration parameter that defines additional
                    command-line parameters to include in the reboot command-line.</li>
                <li>Added <code>wait_for_complete_command</code> that defines whether to detach the
                    complete command or to execute it synchronously and wait for the program to finish.
                    Default is true.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bugs</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Bug: wrong error when missing configuration.xml (invalid schema version vs. missing
                    configuration.xml).</li>
                <li>Bug: reference (web) configurations broken in the editor.</li>
                <li>Bug: wrong semantics of <code>auto_close_if_installed</code>. The bootstrapper will
                    now close after any successful installation session when this option is set.</li>
                <li>Bug: silent install failures pop up error dialogs that don't auto-close.</li>
                <li>Bug: EmbedFolder components broken when configuration is (re)saved with InstallerEditor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Misc</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Refactored the dotNetInstaller bootstrapper into a dotNetInstallerLib C++ library
                    and a GUI driver.</li>
                <li>Extended unit test coverage across C# and C++ installer and support tools libraries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        1.6 (6/29/2009)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>First release off <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dotnetinstaller">CodePlex</a>,
            <a href="http://dotnetinstaller.codeplex.com">http://dotnetinstaller.codeplex.com</a>.</li>
        <li>New MSI installer. You can use the installer or a binary distribution package.</li>
        <li>New, largely rewritten, CHM documentation.</li>
        <li>Changed behavior of file embedding to explicit: disabled automatic embedding of
            files from <code>msi</code>, <code>download</code> and <code>openfile</code> components,
            set <code>/Embed</code> to <code>True</code> by default.</li>
        <li>Added an <code>EmbedFolder</code> configuration component to embed directories and
            subdirectories with an optional wildcard and configurable destination.</li>
        <li>Added parity between <code>EmbedFolder</code> and <code>EmbedFile</code> components
            which can be now specified in both the configuration and on the command line.</li>
        <li>InstallerLinker: embedded files that cannot be found are reported as errors with
            their full paths.</li>
        <li>InstallerLinker: Changed default value of <code>/AppPath</code>, now defaults to
            the current directory and not to the location of the configuration.xml.</li>
        <li>dotNetInstaller: embedded CABs are now segmented into 32-megabyte chunks. This reduces
            the minimum required memory for installers containing embedded CABs to about 48Mb,
            reduces paging and improves performance during extraction of large embedded CABs.
            Added editor and linker support for Windows Vista/XP 64. </li>
        <li>Added OS filter identifiers for Windows Server 2008. </li>
        <li>Added <code>InstalledCheckOperator</code> of 'And', 'Or' and 'Not' types that combine
            results from one or more <code>InstalledCheck</code> and <code>InstalledCheckOperator</code>
            elements. </li>
        <li>dotNetInstaller: Added <code>/componentArgs "component description":"parameters"</code>
            to dotNetInstaller.exe command line. This enables passing additional parameters
            to specific components declared in configuration.xml. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added support for configuration file XML comments and a text box
            where the developer can edit a comment, saved as an xml comment above the selected
            node. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: configuration tree now supports deletion of nodes with the keyboard
            Delete key and will popup the Add menu with the Insert key. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: components can be dragged and dropped between nodes. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: the About box can be closed with the Escape key. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added Expand All, Collapse All, Move, Move Up and Move Down context
            menu items.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: Shift+Up and Shift+Down arrows move components up and down.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added support for multiline properties for most non-caption or
            button messages.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added shortcuts to open a configuratoin file (Ctrl+O), create a
            new configuration file (Ctrl+N), save the current configuration (Ctrl+S), generate
            an exe (F10), exit (Alt+F4) and refresh (F5). </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: user no longer prompted for a configuration file name on New.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: the New and Open menu items are always enabled.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added a status strip that reports general information, including
            Save or Load.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: closing a configuration no longer prompts to save changes when
            there were no changes made.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: writes schema and generator version information to configuration.xml.</li>
        <li>Added <code>allow_continue_on_error</code> globally and per-component: when false
            user is no longer prompted to continue on error, instead the user is informed of
            the failure and installation aborts. Combine this option with <code>auto_close_on_error</code>
            to get predictable failure behavior as bootstrapper will close after an element
            of setup failed. Note that in order for a component to allow continuing on error
            both the global and the component setting must be set to True. </li>
        <li>DotNetInstaller: warns and offers the user to abort if configuration was not generated
            with a matching version of InstallerEditor.</li>
        <li>DotNetInstaller: merged functionality of the Advanced component selector into the
            main window, removed the Advanced button. </li>
        <li>Added <code>dialog_show_required</code>: when false, required components are hidden.</li>
        <li>Added <code>dialog_show_installed</code>: when false, installed components are hidden.</li>
        <li>Added <code>must_reboot_required</code>: globally and per-component. Setting this
            option to true will prevent users from continuing when a reboot is required.</li>
        <li>Added <code>failed_exec_command_continue</code> per-component extending the global
            setting that defines the message to show when a component fails to install.</li>
        <li>Added optional <code>reboot_required</code>: a message that can be configured per
            component, extending the global setting. </li>
        <li>Added <code>auto_close_on_error</code>: changes behavior on component error, now
            optionally closing the bootstrapper. </li>
        <li>Added a set of options that enable resizing of the main installer dialog elements:
            dialog_position <code>dialog_components_list_position</code>, <code>dialog_message_position</code>,
            <code>dialog_bitmap_position</code>, <code>dialog_otherinfo_link_position</code>,
            <code>dialog_osinfo_position</code>, <code>dialog_install_button_position</code>,
            <code>dialog_cancel_button_position</code> and <code>dialog_skip_button_position</code>.
            Supports resizing coordinates selectively.</li>
        <li>Added <code>configuration_no_match_message</code> that displays as error when no
            configuration matching operating system, locale or processor architecture filters
            has been found. Removed unused <code>os_filter_not_match_message</code> and <code>processor_architecture_filter_not_match_message</code>.</li>
        <li>Added <code>#SYSTEMWINDOWSPATH</code> constant resolved to system Windows directory
            in paths.</li>
        <li>Added <code>#PID</code> constant resolved to process ID in paths.</li>
        <li>Added <code>embed</code> option to msi, openfile and download (sub)components to
            disable automatic file embedding.</li>
        <li>Added <code>lcidtype</code> option to the configuration file that can be set to
            the method to use to obtain the current LCID used to match a configuration. Now
            supports user.exe (KB181604), system and user methods.</li>
        <li>Expanded <code>status_installed</code> and <code>status_notinstalled</code> per-component.</li>
        <li>Download dialog <code>autostartdownload</code> default value is changed to <code>
            true</code>.</li>
        <li>Added <code>sourcepath</code> to support mixed-mode physical media distribution
            scenarios where frequently required components are embedded and other components
            downloaded.</li>
        <li>dotNetInstaller process exit code is now 0 on success, MSI return code on an MSI
            component failure, process exit code on a non-zero cmd component return, -2 on cancel
            from main dialog and -1 on any other error. Check <code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code> in batch
            scripts. </li>
        <li>Silent install support was extended to a full UI, basic UI and no UI mode, silent
            install no longer pops up progress dialogs, while basic UI install does without
            requiring user interaction. All UI modes are enabled via configuration and can be
            overriden from command line with /q (silent), /qb (basic UI) and /nq (full UI).</li>
        <li>Hidden folders and files are no longer embedded.</li>
        <li>Added <code>installation_none</code>, displayed instead of <code>installation_complete</code>
            when no components were required. </li>
        <li>Bug: cancel has no effect on the download dialog before download starts.</li>
        <li>Bug: download dialog will no longer appear when download is not required.</li>
        <li>Bug: command-line parameters are not preserved on reboot.</li>
        <li>Bug: /ComponentArgs cannot contain a colon.</li>
        <li>Bug: errors in command line arguments aren't reported.</li>
        <li>Bug: dotNetInstaller doesn't report invalid command-line parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        1.5 (10/25/2008)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for installing 64-bit applications, including WOW support for component
            installed checks, processor architecture restrictions per installation and/or component,
            etc.</li>
        <li>Added support for silent installs; silent mode can be declared either in the configuration
            XML or from the command line.</li>
        <li>Added command_silent to the component of type "command" and cmdparameters_silent
            to the component of type "msi" that optionally replace command and cmdparameters
            parameters in a silent install.</li>
        <li>Added an "alwaysdownload" configuration XML attribute to the download element; if
            this value is false, the file will not be download if it already exists locally
            (this enables using the same configuration XML for both online and offline installs).</li>
        <li>Modified configuration-level OS filter matching to be included as part of the configuration
            filter checks (previously, the program would exit if an unmatched configuration-level
            OS filter was encounter).</li>
        <li>Updated configuration element processing so that all valid configuration blocks
            (matching both OS and LCID filters) will be executed (previously, only the first
            matching block was executed).</li>
        <li>Added environment variable processing support to component commands where the component
            type is "cmd" or "msi".</li>
        <li>Modified complete_command handling so that dotNetInstaller will wait for Command_Complete
            to finish executing.</li>
        <li>Added complete_command_silent to allow overriding complete_command on silent install.</li>
        <li>Added OS filter identifiers for Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP1, Windows
            Server 2003 SP2, and Windows Vista SP1.</li>
        <li>Added optional configuration-level and component-level OS filter matching system
            architecture (x86, x64, etc). See "processor_architecture_filter". This filter restricts
            the entire boostrapper from running on non-supported processors and enables installation
            of different dependencies on different processor architectures.</li>
        <li>Added CABing, embedding of support files using <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/files/CABCompressExtract.aspx">
            Elmue's CAB library</a> and a PackagedSetup sample.</li>
        <li>Added an "Embed File" component, child of "configuration" and "component", to embed
            support files when /Embed is specified.</li>
        <li>Added /ExtractCab command line option to dotNetInstaller.exe that extracts the embedded
            CAB file and its contents in the current directory.</li>
        <li>Added InstallerLinker.exe with command line options /e (Embed) and /a (AppPath)
            and /v (Verbose) for using in build processes.</li>

        <li>Added "cab_dialog_message", "cab_cancelled_message", "cab_dialog_caption", "cab_path"
            and "cab_path_autodelete" options.</li>
        <li>Temporary files (eg. downloaded files) will be deleted upon completion of dotNetInstaller.</li>
        <li>Added /Log command-line option and "log_enabled" configuration file parameter that
            enables logging for dotNetInstaller and all MSI components executed.</li>
        <li>Added /LogFile &lt;path\filename&gt; command-line option and a log_file configuration
            file parameter to specify the resulting full path to the log filename for the dotNetInstaller
            itself.</li>
        <li>Added application version and operating system header to the log output as well
            as a timestamp in front of every log entry.</li>
        <li>Added #CABPATH variable that can be used in path settings.</li>
        <li>Added #GUID variable that represents a unique GUID across a single instance of dotNetInstaller.</li>
        <li>Added an MSBuild script that centrally versions, builds and packages dotNetInstaller
            into target/Debug|Release, including a sample.</li>
        <li>Added a combined Visual Studio solution, dni.sln with automatic versioning (reqiures
            <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/">MSBuild Community Tasks</a>); the major
            and minor version number can be incremented in dni.proj, the build number is the
            latest SVN revision and the release number is a timestamp.</li>
        <li>Added features to specify additional binary information, including copyright or
            company name, specifically "file_version" and "product_version" configuration attributes,
            as well as free-formed string attributes, using <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/ResourceLib.aspx">
                ResourceLib</a>.</li>
        <li>Added a component "required" option; a required component cannot be de-selected
            in the Advanced tab and complete_command is only executed when all reqiured components
            have been installed.</li>
        <li>Added /CompleteCommandArgs "value" to dotNetInstaller.exe to pass additional parameters
            to "complete_command" and "complete_command_silent".</li>
        <li>Added horizontal scrollbars in component lists that can't fit all the text in.</li>
